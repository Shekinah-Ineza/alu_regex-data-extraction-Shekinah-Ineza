# Regex Data Extraction – ALU Hackathon


This project was developed as part of the ALU Frontend Web Development course's "Formative One – Regex Onboarding Hackathon."

It extracts specific types of data (like emails, phone numbers, URLs, credit card numbers, etc.) from a large body of text using Regular Expressions in Python.

The goal is to simulate a backend system that scrapes and cleans web data using pattern matching techniques.
